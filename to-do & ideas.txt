Here we can write down all that we have to do, so that we know what each person
has to do or thinks should be done with the game.
If anyone wants to take lead of something, write down your name so we don't mess up.
That way we can both give and have a selection of things that can/should be done.

And same goes for the ideas:
If anyone comes up with a cool mechanic, cool scenario or really, anything,
type it down under the ideas so we can review them.
Same for the plot - what the player may have to do, where, when, how, what may happen if they
fail to do so, what events may happen during their journey, anything of that sort.

Make sure to share your thoughts, that way we can best
decide if something is worth it or not, if it is a good idea or not, etc.
All feedback is welcome!

=====
To-Do:
=====

Think of basic plot, room descriptions, review room items (choose and add/remove), talk about the items' function,
what they will do, where they will be used, anything special the room might have but is unobtainable
(like a big board on which a number is written which you can use to open something, maybe) and such.

=====
Ideas:
=====

Plot - For now, the idea is to go with a Sci-Fi, space-like setting.
Plot - As player enters new spaceship, he gets locked behind - has to find a keycard if they want to get out later.
Plot - Power goes out, must be switched on to use anything involving electricity (like swiping keycards and opening doors).
Plot/Extra - Player has to obtain a random key each time a new game is started and use it to unlock a door/something where they can
    find/get/do something.
