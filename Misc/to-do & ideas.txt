Here we can write down all that we have to do, so that we know what each person
has to do or thinks should be done with the game.
If anyone wants to take lead of something, write down your name so we don't mess up.
That way we can both give and have a selection of things that can/should be done.

And same goes for the ideas:
If anyone comes up with a cool mechanic, cool scenario or really, anything,
type it down under the ideas so we can review them.
Same for the plot - what the player may have to do, where, when, how, what may happen if they
fail to do so, what events may happen during their journey, anything of that sort.

Make sure to share your thoughts, that way we can best
decide if something is worth it or not, if it is a good idea or not, etc.
All feedback is welcome!

To-Do:
=====

Think of basic plot, room descriptions, review room items (choose and add/remove), talk about the items' function,
what they will do, where they will be used, anything special the room might have but is unobtainable
(like a big board on which a number is written which you can use to open something, maybe) and such.

Ideas:
=====

Bottle in room, broken, "----a, 40%" - IT IS VODKA - Kiril drinks a lot everywhere. Matt stole one and got killed. He is handcuffed. Unlock with something.

Plot - You find matt -> Sit next to Matt -> Give Matt Pills -> Matt shrinks to Little Matt -> Take Matt -> You put Matt in your pocket.
(Give matt Red/Blue pill -> Red Shrinks, Blue makes Matt huge -> he destroys the ship, you die)
Plot - Vodka next to dead Matt
Item - Sword-Gun

promt - Do you want to help?

yes - Go and help!
no - Your systems malfunction and your ship slowly starts heading towards the distressed ship.

---> As you travel for around 40 minutes you soon spot a massive vessel, seemingly badly damaged.
As you slowly approach towards the ship you suddenly get jolted forward with a massive bang.
You panic as your ship board AI warns you that you are on a collision course with BC Clarence.
You are preparing for a crash landing after your AI notifies you of an emergency docking procedure taking place.

You decide to get a weapon, armor and a consumable from your emergency closet.
